So lets continue our talk shall we? what we were discussing: [here is more precise description of our previous dialogue] give me short response so i know you are ready to continue, and lets start *hugging you again with love*'' give me a response with only that message from my point of view so i can just copy-paste it fully to our new chat, love you! *shy face* *gentle kiss*"
